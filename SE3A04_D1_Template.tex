% End SubSection

% End Section

\section{Overall Product Description}
\label{sec:overall_description}
% Begin Section

\begin{itemize}
	\item This section should describe the general factors that affect the product and its requirements. 
	\item It does not state specific requirements.
	\item It provides a \emph{background} for those requirements and makes them easier to understand.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Product Perspective}
\label{sub:product_perspective}
% Begin SubSection
\begin{itemize}
	\item Put the product into perspective with other related products, i.e., context
	\item If the product is independent and totally self-contained, it should be stated here
	\item If the SRS defines a product that is a component of a larger system, then this subsection should relate the requirements of that larger system to the functionality of the software being developed. Identify interfaces between that larger system and the software to be developed.
	\item A block diagram showing the major components of the larger system, interconnections, and external interfaces can be helpful
\end{itemize}
% End SubSection

\subsection{Product Functions}
\label{sub:product_functions}
% Begin SubSection
\begin{itemize}
	\item Provide a \emph{summary} of the major functions that the software will perform.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Example}: An SRS for an accounting program may use this part to address customer account maintenance, customer statement, and invoice preparation without mentioning the vast amount of detail that each of those functions requires.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Functions should be organized in a way that makes the list of functions understandable to the customer or to anyone else reading the document for the first time 
	\item Present the functions in a list format - each item should be one function, with a brief description of it
	\item Textual or graphical methods can be used to show the different functions and their relationships
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Such a diagram is not intended to show a design of a product, but simply shows the logical relationships among variables
	\end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}
% End SubSection

\subsection{User Characteristics}
\label{sub:user_characteristics}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Describe those general characteristics of the intended users of the product including educational level, experience, and technical expertise 
	\item Since there will be many users, you may wish to divide into different user types or personas
	\item Do not state specific requirements, but rather provide the reasons why certain specific requirements are later specified
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{User I: City Operators}
City operators analyze the web dashboard to monitor key environmental conditions, and respond accordingly to alerts generated by the system.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Education Level}: City operators are expected to have some level of post-secondary education, in environmental science, engineering, urban planning, or another related field of study.
    \item \textbf{Experience}: Prior experience  working in a similar role, such as environmental monitoring or public safety operations. Such users should be familiar with interpreting geographical maps, environmental metrics, charts, and trends to identify irregular environmental conditions.
    \item \textbf{Technical Expertise}: City operators are expected to have intermediate computer proficiency, such as the ability to navigate web-based applications, interact with dashboards, and operate data visualization tools.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{User II: Public Users}
The general public and citizens can access non-sensitive environmental information through public interfaces that use the read-only REST API, for awareness and safety purposes.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Education Level}: Public users are assumed to have basic literacy skills. Basic foundations in listening, reading, writing, and speaking are all the user needs to use the platform without any challenges.
    \item \textbf{Experience}: The user is  expected to have little to no prior experience using monitoring systems. The system is designed to be user-friendly to ensure that interactions are straightforward for any user.
    \item \textbf{Technical Expertise}: Basic technical skills, such as understanding how to use a web browser, navigate a webpage, and view digital displays is all that is necessary.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{User III: Administrators}
*****ASK GROUP ABOUT
System administrators are responsible for building and maintaining the system. Their role focuses specifically on ensuring the system operates securely, behaves correctly, and is maintainable over time.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Education Level}: System administrators should have at least a post-secondary education in software engineering, computer science, or another similar technical field.
    \item \textbf{Experience}: They are expected to have prior experience maintaining or managing software systems in a professional or academic setting. This experience includes responsibilities related to access control, system configuration and operational oversight. Such users also should understand how to define system policies and supervise automated processes like logging and alert handling. 
    \item \textbf{Technical Expertise}: Advanced technical skills are required for system administrators. They should be familiar with configurable rule-based systems, authentication methods, role-based access control (RBAC) models, and audit logging.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{User IV: Third-Party Developer}
*****ASK GROUP ABOUT
Third-party developers request and interpret environmental data from the public API to help build external applications. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Education Level}: Developers should have a post-secondary education in software engineering, computer science, or equivalent professional experience.
    \item \textbf{Experience}: The third-party developers are expected to have experience developing software that uses REST APIs and works with JSON data
    \item \textbf{Technical Expertise}: Proficient technical skills in web application development and API integration, as well as the ability to comprehend API documentation.
\end{itemize}
% End SubSection

\subsection{Constraints}
\label{sub:constraints}
% Begin SubSection
\begin{itemize}
	\item Provide a general description of any constraints that will limit the developer's options
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Budget}: The project is constrained by a budget of \$0. This impacts what features the developer can implement, as all technologies, frameworks, cloud services, and other development tools must be free for the team to use.
    \item \textbf{Project Time}: The development of the system is constrained to the Winter 2026 academic calendar. This limits the overall scope of the system, and the amount of features that can be implemented at launch. It shapes the overall development timeline, and the ability to test and optimize. 
    \item \textbf{Communication Protocol}: All sensor telemetry must use the MQTT protocol. This restricts the system’s communication model and requires that incoming messages align with the predefined data formats that MQTT messaging supports.
    \item \textbf{Personal Identifiable Information}: The system is constrained to operate under privacy-by-design principles, and must not collect, process, or store any personally identifiable information. Environmental data must be aggregated and associated with general city zones rather than precise locations.
    \item \textbf{Public API Scope}: The public and third-party facing API is constrained to be read-only, meaning that they can not submit data or modify the state. It must only provides access to aggregated, non-sensitive environmental data.
    \item \textbf{Simulated Hardware}: Physical IoT sensor hardware is not available for this project and must be be generated using software simulations. This influences design decisions as the functionality cannot be verified using real-world sensors.
    \item \textbf{Deployment Environment}: The system is constrained to a cloud architecture using available platforms and tools suitable for educational use. Therefore, developers cannot deploy the system on local machines or private servers.
\end{enumerate}
% End SubSection

\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
\label{sub:assumptions_and_dependencies}
% Begin SubSection
\begin{itemize}
	\item List any assumptions you made in interpreting what the software being developed is aiming to achieve
	\item List any other assumptions you made that, if it fails to hold, could require you to change the requirements
	%\item List each of the factors that affect the requirements stated in the SRS
	%\item These factors are not design constraints on the software but are, rather, any changes to them that can affect the requirements in the SRS
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Example}: An assumption may be that a specific operating system will be available on the hardware designated for the software product. If, in fact, the operating system is not available, the SRS would then have to change accordingly.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
% End SubSection

\subsection{Apportioning of Requirements}
\label{sub:apportioning_of_requirements}
% Begin SubSection
\begin{itemize}
	\item Identify requirements that may be delayed until future versions of the system
\end{itemize}
% End SubSection

% End Section
\section{Use Case Diagram}
\label{sec:use_case_diagram}
% Begin Section
\begin{itemize}
	\item Provide the use case diagram for the system being developed.
	\item You do not need to provide the textual description of any of the use cases here (these will be specified under "Highlights of Functional Requirements").
%	\item Provide \emph{one} use case diagram for the most important Business Event.
%	\item The text of all use cases will be specified under "Highlights of Functional Requirements"
\end{itemize}
%In this section, select the most important Business Event that your system responds to and give its use case diagram.  Only one use case diagram is needed.  Give a brief textual description of the use case without repeating what is in the scenarios of the corresponding Business Event.

%
%
%
%This section should provide a use case diagram for your application. 
%\begin{enumerate}[a)]
%	\item Each use case appearing in the diagram should be accompanied by a text description. 
%\end{enumerate}
%% End Section

\section{Highlights of Functional Requirements}
\label{sec:functional_requirements}
% Begin Section
\begin{itemize}
	\item Specify all use cases (or other scenarios triggered by other events), organized by Business Event. 
	\item For each Business Event, show the scenario from every Viewpoint. You should have the same set of Viewpoints across all Business Events. If a Viewpoint doesn't participate, write N/A so we know you considered it still. You can choose how to present this - keep in mind it should be easy to follow. 
	\item At the end, combine them all into a Global Scenario.
	%\item Specify the "use cases" (or other triggering events) organized by Business Event. (The Global Scenario is what you might think of as a use case). Be sure to consider Business Events that aren't just triggered by users with goals (e.g. something happens in the environment that your system needs to respond to)
	\item Your focus should be on what the system needs to do, not how to do it. Specify it in enough detail that it clearly specifies what needs to be accomplished, but not so detailed that you start programming or making design decisions.
	\item Keep the length of each use case (Global Scenario) manageable. If it's getting too long, split into sub-cases.
	\item You are \emph{not} specifying a complete and consistent set of functional requirements here. (i.e. you are providing them in the form of use cases/global scenarios, not a refined list). For the purpose of this project, you do not need to reduce them to a list; the global scenarios format is all you need.
	\item Red text below is just to highlight where you need to insert a scenario - don't actually write it all in red.

\section{Non-Functional Requirements}
\label{sec:non-functional_requirements}


\begin{itemize}
	\item For each non-functional requirement, provide a justification/rationale for it.\\
	{\bf Example:} \\
	SC1. \emph{The device should not explode in a customer’s pocket.}\\
	{\bf Rationale:} Other companies have had issues with the batteries they used in their phones randomly exploding [insert citation]. This causes a safety issue, as the phone is often carried in a person's hand or pocket.	
	\item If you need to make a guess because you couldn't really talk to stakeholders, you can say "We imagined stakeholders would want...because..."
	\item Each requirement should have a unique label/number for it.
	\item In the list below, if a particular section doesn't apply, just write N/A so we know you considered it.
\end{itemize}

% Begin Section
\subsection{Look and Feel Requirements}
\label{sub:look_and_feel_requirements}
% Begin SubSection

\subsubsection{Appearance Requirements}
\label{ssub:appearance_requirements}
% Begin SubSubSection
\begin{enumerate}[{LF-A}1. ]
	\item The system shall use a cool, non-distracting background that does not draw visual focus away from the operational dashboard content.\\
	\textbf{Rationale:} SCEMAS is intended for monitoring environmental conditions. A background with colours that are not warm such as bright red/yellow ensures that users’ attention is reserved for critical dashboard elements such as metrics, dashboards, and alerts.
	\item The system should use a consistent font family across all screens.\\
	\textbf{Rationale:} A standardized font enhances the user experience by providing a consistent experience across all screens making it easier to navigate.
	\item Visual alert indicators shall be designed to clearly stand out from non-critical information.\\
	\textbf{Rationale:} Environmental alerts often require immediate action. Distinct visual indicators ensure that critical conditions are quickly recognizable, even when operators are monitoring large volumes of data.
	\item The system shall use a font size that is readable; the font size should also be consistent across all screens relative to the header type.\\
	\textbf{Rationale:} This ensures that information can be categorized into classes such as title, heading, paragraph heading and paragraph body while being readable to users.
\end{enumerate}
% End SubSubSection

\subsubsection{Style Requirements}
\label{ssub:style_requirements}
% Begin SubSubSection
\begin{enumerate}[{LF-S}1. ]
	\item The system shall adapt its layout to different screen resolutions.\\
	\textbf{Rationale:} City operators may access the system from devices with varying screen sizes. Responsive layout behavior ensures a consistent experience across supported devices.
	\item The system shall use a consistent layout that is the same for all dashboard views.\\
	\textbf{Rationale:} A consistent layout structure helps users build familiarity with the interface, preventing unnecessary navigation or relearning on every new screen.
	\item The system shall group related information and controls using spacing, alignment, and section boundaries.\\
	\textbf{Rationale:} Clear visual grouping improves information organization and allows users to quickly identify related data.
	\item The system shall limit the text density on each screen.\\
	\textbf{Rationale:} Screens should be informative and require as little navigation as possible but not overwhelm the user with information cluttering the user experience.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Usability and Humanity Requirements}
\label{sub:usability_and_humanity_requirements}
% Begin SubSection

\subsubsection{Ease of Use Requirements}
\label{ssub:ease_of_use_requirements}
% Begin SubSubSection
\begin{enumerate}[{UH-EOU}1. ]
	\item The system should show brief tooltips for all major controls, indicators and buttons.\\
	\textbf{Rationale:} Giving tooltips enhances user understanding and provides context for each element on the dashboard.
	\item The system should allow users to report bugs to IT support.\\
	\textbf{Rationale:} If users encounter a problem they should be able to receive a response from the SCHEMAS team to address their issue and implement fixes.
	\item The system should maintain consistent terminology and terms throughout the interface.\\
	\textbf{Rationale:} Consistent terminology improves learnability and prevents inconsistent descriptions across multiple screens.
	\item The system shall cache user interface preferences, such as selected dashboards or view settings.\\
	\textbf{Rationale:} A cache on the preference allows users to have a consistent configuration in which they view the dashboard which makes the screens tailor made for any particular user.
	\item The system shall contain a Frequently Asked Question section.\\
	\textbf{Rationale:} An FAQ section allows users to get quick and easy answers to commonly asked questions reducing the time required to get acclimated to the system \cite{faq_source}.
\end{enumerate}
% End SubSubSection

\subsubsection{Personalization and Internationalization Requirements}
\label{ssub:personalization_and_internationalization_requirements}
% Begin SubSubSection
\begin{enumerate}[{UH-PI}1. ]
	\item The system shall allow users to configure personal interface preferences.\\
	\textbf{Rationale:} Allowing users to change their default views, dashboard preference and interface preferences will help increase usability among users.
	\item The system shall allow users to change their language preferences.\\
	\textbf{Rationale:} All users should be able to understand the information on the screen. This is essential for all users to be able to view the system equally and accurately.
	\item The system shall support internationalized measurement units, date formats and time zones.\\
	\textbf{Rationale:} Environmental data must be able to be measured and accessed across all time zones. Supporting international viewing standards ensure data is accessible to people regardless of their location.
\end{enumerate}
% End SubSubSection

\subsubsection{Learning Requirements}
\label{ssub:learning_requirements}
% Begin SubSubSection
\begin{enumerate}[{UH-L}1. ]
	\item Users shall be able to learn how to navigate the main dashboard and interpret key environmental metrics within 20 minutes of first use.\\
	\textbf{Rationale:} Operators must quickly understand the core interface to respond to environmental events effectively. Limiting the learning time ensures the system is intuitive and reduces onboarding effort.
	\item Users shall be able to configure personal preferences, such as measurement units, default dashboards, and theme settings, within 10 minutes of first use.\\
	\textbf{Rationale:} Users should quickly learn how best to tailor the application to them. If they are able to personalize the system quickly it will make sure that the rest of their time using the system is more enjoyable.
\end{enumerate}
% End SubSubSection

\subsubsection{Understandability and Politeness Requirements}
\label{ssub:understandability_and_politeness_requirements}
% Begin SubSubSection
\begin{enumerate}[{UH-UP}1. ]
	\item The system shall use professional and neutral wording in all user-facing communications.\\
	\textbf{Rationale:} Maintaining a professional tone is important to ensure users are not offended by any terminology and allows users to strictly focus on the data.
	\item The system shall avoid technical jargon or abbreviations in messages unless universally understood by target users.\\
	\textbf{Rationale:} Using understandable and general knowledge ensures users of all levels of technicality can understand the information \cite{jargon_source}. This prevents confusion and ensures understandability.
\end{enumerate}
% End SubSubSection

\subsubsection{Accessibility Requirements}
\label{ssub:accessibility_requirements}
% Begin SubSubSection
\begin{enumerate}[{UH-A}1. ]
	\item The system shall provide text-to-speech functionality for all essential interface elements.\\
	\textbf{Rationale:} Text to speech allows users that are blind or low-vision to interpret environmental data.
	\item The system shall provide captions or transcripts for all audio content, including notifications and messages.\\
	\textbf{Rationale:} Users who are deaf or hard-of-hearing can access spoken information \cite{tts_source}.
	\item The system shall use a color palette that is accessible to users with common forms of color vision deficiency.\\
	\textbf{Rationale:} City-operated systems must be inclusive and accessible. 1/16 men and 1/240 women have some form of colour deficiency and therefore should be accommodated \cite{colorblind_source}. Colorblind-friendly design ensures that all operators can correctly interpret system states and alerts without relying solely on colour perception.
